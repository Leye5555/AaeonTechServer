# Aaeon Tech

Introduction

This is a fintech solutions api built with MongoDB, Express and NodeJs . It also has features such as JWT authentication, bcrypt password hashing, payment gateway integration etc.

Functionality (What does the app do?)

It can execute the following:

> Create and add users to a database

> Authenticate existing users

> Enable e-wallet transactions (money transfers) between existing users

> Validate and then add credit or debit cards to accounts of existing users

> Fetch live business news feed for Nigeria(since this is my home country :) )

> Fetch all banks in Nigeria

Overview

This app does not deal with real cash as it is only meant to mirror real cash transactions. The card authentication is however very accurate as it uses the api of a known payment gateway (Paystack).
